# TO-DO
This is a feature-rich Todo List application built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS â€” with no external frameworks or libraries. The goal of this project is to demonstrate clean code architecture, modular design, and modern front-end development best practices using just the core web technologies.
